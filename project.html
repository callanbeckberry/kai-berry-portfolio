        <!-- Summary -->
              <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>
                The Cloud Storage space is market that's changing at a rapid rate, with ample space for growth. Despite this, you'll find very little difference between the main players. From a market stance, and visual impact, there's a lot of room to maneuver into a strong position.
                <br><br>
                My client needed a way to break in to the industry and stand out from the pack, be it through design, function, or market.
                </p>
        <!-- Problem -->
              <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>
                My client was looking to break into the crowded Cloud Storage space. They knew that this was technology they wanted to invest in, but they didn't have an idea of who their users could be.
                </p>
                <p>
                If my client wanted to break into the cloud storage platform, they needed answers first. I wanted to provide these answers on their behalf. To do so, I needed to create a break-in strategy to the cloud storage space from scratch.
                </p>
        <!-- Solution -->
              <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>
                  Cloud storage is a simple, powerful tool that is often underutilized, due to thought process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a saturated market like this one, we saw a way to utilize the narrative of what cloud storage could mean. Emphasizing less of the technical function of the system, and more of the empathetic one. A place to collaborate, and share easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe there’s a place to stand out with the thought-driven cloud storage platform. The result was Therefore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You think, therefore your ideas deserve to be shared. You work with other thinkers, and therefore should have easy access to your collective thoughts whenever needed.
                </p>
        <!-- Research START -->
              <h1>Research</h1>
        <!-- Survey -->
                <h2 class="Subdivision">Survey</h2>
                  <p>
                    I started by researching our users via a comprehensive survey. Then, I could know their past experience, and current usage of cloud storage solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I found that 88% of users have a cloud storage solution for personal and professional work, and use their solution across multiple devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also found that the main ask for a platform is the ability to easily share files with other users, and to be able to collaborate with other users in real time.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I created two user personas that captured the audience we wanted: Moderate to Expert level tech users looking to work with others personally and professionally.

                    These user stories helped us whittle down to the core features of what we were looking for:

                    Finally, I was able to start creating what would become Therefore. Starting with what would be the biggest hurdle of the project, wireframes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fired up, I started creating high-fidelity mockups without formalizing wireframes, or even branding!
                  </p>
        <!-- Early Mockups -->
                <h2 class="Subdivision">Early Mockups</h2>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <p>
                    This ended up being a mistake. While a lot of the ideas I had in this early draft would carry over into future iterations, mockups were  inconsistent. Buttons, asset placement, weren't on grid. I also overlooked many key screens that we needed to convey. I loved the colors of this iteration, but the low contrast design had issues with indicating CTAs. Users found it harder to read, as it wasn't design with accessibility in mind. It was back to square one, this time to wireframe correctly, and consistently.
                  </p>
        <!-- Wireframing -->
                <h2 class="Subdivision">Wireframing</h2>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <p>
                    I recreated all our mockups as basic wireframes - consistent and on grid. With this done, the platform's bones were in place, and we could focus on branding. I utilized our past survey, competitive analysis, and lessons learned from our very first mockup to come up with a unique vision.
                  </p>
        <!-- Branding and Logos -->
                <h2 class="Subdivision">Branding and Logos</h2>
                  <p>
                    The main idea we wanted to get across was that this was a platform for ‘thinkers’, and a place to share ideas. We started brainstorming our logos…
                  </p>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <p>
                    Before landing with what we like to call the “Cloud Brain”.
                  </p>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <p>
                    The “Cloud Brain” emphasizes everything Therefore stands for. Four circles, each a possible idea, come together to form a brain. The collective thoughts are stronger together. Plus, it sort of looks like a “T”. That's cool.
                  </p>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <p>
                    Next, I leveraged the first mockup to create a higher contrast color palette for our style guide. This color palette would end up changing drastically with each iteration. With each iteration we'd continue to improve contract and accessibility.
                  </p>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                  <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                   <p>
                     We went to improving our wireframes, this time properly creating higher fidelity mockups. Additionally, we tackled how mobile would look for the first time. I took applied the color palette to Material Design Guidelines, creating an Android-based app. We finally had prototypes for mobile and desktop that we could test on users…
                   </p>
        <!-- 2nd Round Testing -->
                <h2 class="Subdivision">2nd Round Testing</h2>
                <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                <img class="case-img" alt="Image Description" src=""/>
                <p>
                  Finally I could get the desktop and Android app into the hands of users. Immediately, I learned that users didn't want to have a separate web app and Android app. Instead they preferred a more unified experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                  We noted their needs, and scrapped the Android app entirely. We refocused mobile efforts into a mobile view of our dedicated web app.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This round of testing would give us some of the most simple, but influential feedback from our users. A few small tweaks go a long way!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I ended up altering the style guide to provide stronger CTAs, colors and buttons. Fonts were changed, improving legibility, size and style. This gave a smoother and more ‘professional’ looking experience, making sure that a visual hierarchy was always in place for the user.

                 <p class="white">
                  The client’s vague asks concerned me initially. To handle this I latched on to some hastily made core concepts and branding decisions. While these decisions seemed to give the client a way to break into the market/stand out with minimal effort, they turned into a double edged sword!
                </p>
                <p class="white">
                  It definitely pays off to create and rally around a strong direction early on in the process. That said, I designed ahead of myself. With vague concepts of what might work for users, no finalized branding, style guide, or even basic wireframes, we delivered a final product. Therefore's hardest lesson learned was the fallout when proper foundation isn't set early.
                </p>
                <p class="white">
                  On the flip side, that strong initial direction stayed relevant through the entire process - always acting as a guiding light of the product. Many initial colors and flows stayed through even our final mockups and prototypes. While it’s very important to solidify this guiding light early on in the project, I now know that it's important to remain flexible with our early ideas. I'll keep an open mind for future projects, and what initial concepts could become. I'll research, create, and iterate with more deliberation going forward!
